                My name is Ronnie Raymond Rogers. (Yes, my initials are RRR.) I'm a 28 year-old software engineer currently living in the Greater Los Angeles area.  I began my tech journey after spending the first 9 years of my professional career as an HVAC/R technician.  I began self-teaching web development by watching videos and completing courses on Free Code Camp.  After about six months of self-teaching, I enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course with General Assembly.  I graduated as of March 2022 and am currently seeking my first professional role as a developer.
